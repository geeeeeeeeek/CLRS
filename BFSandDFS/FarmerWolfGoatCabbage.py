'''(Farmer,Wolf,Goat,Cabbage)'''
'''A farmer with its wolf, goat, and cabbage come to the edge of a river they wish to
    cross. There is a boat at the riverâ€™s edge, but, of course, only the farmer can row. the
    boat also can carry only two things (including the rower) at a time. If the wolf is ever
    left alone with the goat, the wolf will eat the goat; similarly, if the goat is left alone
    with the cabbage, the goat will eat the cabbage. Devise a sequence of crossings of the
    river so that all four characters arrive safely on the other side of the river. '''
