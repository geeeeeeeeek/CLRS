# Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears
# more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.
#
# You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

    # @param num, a list of integers

# Runtime: O(n2) — Brute force solution: Check each element if it is the majority element.
# Runtime: O(n), Space: O(n) — Hash table: Maintain a hash table of the counts of each element, then find the most
# common one.
# Runtime: O(n log n) — Sorting: As we know more than half of the array are elements of the same value, we can sort the
# array and all majority elements will be grouped into one contiguous chunk. Therefore, the middle (n/2th) element must
#  also be the majority element.
# Average runtime: O(n), Worst case runtime: Infinity — Randomization: Randomly pick an element and check if it is the
# majority element. If it is not, do the random pick again until you find the majority element. As the probability to
# pick the majority element is greater than 1/2, the expected number of attempts is < 2.
# Runtime: O(n log n) — Divide and conquer: Divide the array into two halves, then find the majority element A in the
#  first half and the majority element B in the second half. The global majority element must either be A or B.
# If A == B, then it automatically becomes the global majority element. If not, then both A and B are the candidates for
#  the majority element, and it is suffice to check the count of occurrences for at most two candidates. The runtime
# complexity, T(n) = T(n/2) + 2n = O(n log n).
# Runtime: O(n) — Moore voting algorithm: We maintain a current candidate and a counter initialized to 0. As we iterate
#  the array, we look at the current element x:
# If the counter is 0, we set the current candidate to x and the counter to 1.
# If the counter is not 0, we increment or decrement the counter based on whether x is the current candidate.
# After one pass, the current candidate is the majority element. Runtime complexity = O(n).
# Runtime: O(n) — Bit manipulation: We would need 32 iterations, each calculating the number of 1's for the ith bit of
# all n numbers. Since a majority must exist, therefore, either count of 1's > count of 0's or vice versa (but can never
# be equal). The majority number’s ith bit must be the one bit that has the greater count.
